The steps:

1) Calibration of the red sequence

a) Write scripts to get data from SDSS DR8, both photometric and spectroscopic

2) Applying red sequence model to get probabilities for each galaxy to be part
of the red sequence.

3) Percolation of nearby red sequence galaxies to get tentative memberships

4) Refinement of cluster redshifts and membership probabilities, includes
centering measurements.
